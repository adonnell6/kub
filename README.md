Answers the question: what play do I have given a current state of the board and tiles in your hand. The printed output tells you what to play from your hand and what the final board state should be — you have to figure out how to reorganize the board to get there

Currently this is deathly slow 😱

```
Existing combinations on board:
   ['🟥  1', '🟥  2', '🟥  3']
   ['🟥  4', '🟥  5', '🟥  6']
   ['🟥  8', '🟥  9', '🟥 10', '🌟']
Best play found:
  Tiles to play: ['🟧  1', '🟧  2', '🟧  3', '🟧  4', '🟥  7', '⬛️  4']
  Combination on board:
     ['🟥  1', '🟥  2', '🟥  3']
     ['🟥  4', '🟥  5', '🟥  6']
     ['🌟', '🟧  4', '⬛️  4']
     ['🟧  1', '🟧  2', '🟧  3']
     ['🟥  8', '🟥  9', '🟥 10', '🟥  7']
```
